  "MedWaste" was Team BPX's submission to the 2023 USC Viterbi / Marshall Grief Innovation Challenge titled "AI and Sustainability."

  Based on hypothetical data collected by our company, we would assign hospitals  a "MedWaste score," based on the amount of waste produced by these institutions due to five measured factors (see code comments).
Along with our k-NN model which works as a way to confirm the classification of a hospital as grade A - grade F, we additionally created a Figma prototype that provided hospitals with resources to understand
their grade and improve.

  My role for this project was coding this algorithm, as well as pitching this code during our presentation. Out of ~20 teams comprised of both undergraduate and graduate students, our team won third place!
